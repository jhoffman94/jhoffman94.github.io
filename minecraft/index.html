  <h1>SkyFactory 4 Minecraft Server</h1>
  <p>This page details specific changes that were made to the stock SkyFactory 4 modpack for our server playthrough.</p>
  <h2>World Changes</h2>
  <p>The overworld uses the Sky Island world gen. No other changes have been made to other dimensions from SkyFactory 4 defaults.<br />
    New players should use the command: <strong>/topography island home</strong> to have the game assign them an island to build on.</p>
  <h2>Recipe Changes</h2>
  <p><i>Changes to the AE2 processor recipes are balanced to require the same technologies as you would need to create the item through the use of the stock AE2 inscriber recipe.<br />
    This is a quality-of-life recipe addition as the AE2 Inscriber is very difficult to sanely automate.<br />
    The presses are <strong>not consumed</strong> as part of the craft and any mod's Silicon can be used.<br />
    The <strong>left</strong> recipe is intended for use in a crafting table - the presses will not be consumed.<br />
    The <strong>right</strong> recipe is intended for AE2 autocrafting - which will require some inscriber automation.</i></p>
