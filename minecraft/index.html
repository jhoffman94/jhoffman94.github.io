  <h1>SkyFactory 4 Minecraft Server</h1>
  <p>This page details specific changes that were made to the stock SkyFactory 4 modpack for our playthrough.</p>
  <h2>Recipe Changes</h2>
  <p><i>Admin notes: Custom changes to the AE2 processor recipes are balanced to require the same technologies as you would need to create the item through the use of the stock AE2 inscriber recipe.<br />
    This is a QoL recipe change as the AE2 Inscriber is very difficult to sanely automate.</i></p>
